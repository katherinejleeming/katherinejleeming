# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!
- Hi, Iâ€™m @katherinejleeming or Katie for short!
- I began my coding journey earlier this year starting in front end development before taking the leap to C++ for game development in the summer.
- I work with the RAF Air Cadets software development team working on applications for the organisation focusing on UI/UX.
- Iâ€™m currently continuing to learn C++ for Games Programming with Sumo Digital's Playbuffer after completing their Diversity Internship Training Programme in 2023.
- Below you'll find some examples of the work I undertook on the internship as well as in my spare time developing my game programming skills.

**Languages**
- C++
- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript
