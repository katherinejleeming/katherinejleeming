# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!
- Hi, Iâ€™m @katherinejleeming or Katie for short!
- I began my coding journey earlier this year starting in front end development before taking the leap to C++ for game development in the summer.
- Iâ€™m currently learning C++ with Sumo Digital on their Diversity Internship Training Programme.
- Below you'll find some examples of the work I undertook on the internship as well as in my spare time developing my game programming skills.

**Languages**
- C++
- HTML, CSS & JavaScript


### ðŸŒ± C++ Projects
#### Games developed using [SumoDigital's Playbuffer](https://github.com/sumo-digital-academy/playbuffer), a single-header C++ library for making simple 2D games.
[Sky High Spyder](https://github.com/katherinejleeming/sky-high-spyder)
- An asteroids style game depicting multiple essential C++ concepts for game programming.
